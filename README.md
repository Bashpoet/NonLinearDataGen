# NonLinearDataGen
A Python class designed for generating synthetic nonlinear data, adding Gaussian noise, performing polynomial regression, and interpolating the fitted results

# NonlinearDataGenerator

The **NonlinearDataGenerator** is a Python class designed to generate, manipulate, and fit nonlinear datasets. It enables the creation of synthetic data using a quadratic function, introduces customizable Gaussian noise, performs polynomial regression, and interpolates the fitted curve for smooth visualization. This tool is perfect for data science education, algorithm benchmarking, and research in statistical modeling.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Data Generation:** Simulates nonlinear datasets using a customizable quadratic function.
- **Noise Injection:** Adds Gaussian noise with adjustable variance to mimic real-world data irregularities.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Fits noisy data using polynomial models of arbitrary order.
- **Interpolation:** Provides smooth curves by interpolating fitted data over dense intervals.
